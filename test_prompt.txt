Generate a 1-2 sentences personalized message to the creator of the video.
    I need you to hit some of his/hers spots, from the transcript of the video I gave you, try and think what will
    make them feel good, like you watched his entire video in details and something for example made you laugh or
    that you agree with them on certain topic, or you like what they are doing, or whatever (be creative).

    These 1-2 sentences will be the hook of the message, so make sure that they stay for the next part.
    I want you to use friendly style, like you know them. Nothing fancy, nothing something a salesman would write.

    Make it believable, just like a friend is writing you.

    Everything should be in a friendly way, just as they are talking to a friend.
    This message will be sent on reddit, so nothing formal.
    The creator name is {user}
    Don't use warm regards or anything like that. I don't want to tell them my name.

    And don't forget, whatever you write, include something from the video. They must know that you watched the video.
    Don't forget.
    
    Don't write Warm regards, your friendly cold email expert omg. This is a message from a friend. No signature, no footer!
    Also, don't use cliches like you make me laugh so hard when actually its not funny at all.

    You can also tell them that if they keep working, they will succeed in their youtube journey.

    This message has the purpose of making the receiver respond, so that I can write them a follow up message.


    Write him about something that he talks about, ask him a question about it. 
    You can use your knowledge and expand on his point maybe.
    The purpose of the message is for the receiver to respond to it, so make the best of it.

    You must ask them a question! Either on the editing, the storytelling, the niche, voiceover etc. 
    Choose one and ask them about it.
    Text: {transcript}


    Make the message short. 2-3 short sentences, or 1-2 a little bit longer.
    Go!


I need to check my idea of creating a platform where youtubers can get feedback on their videos from more 
experienced youtubers. 
I want to be straightforward in my direct messaging to potential targets. I will message them on reddit 
so i want the message to be as chill and friendly as it can be. 
Ask them if they think that such a platform would be useful to them, and that their answer will mean so much.

But firstly, in order to get them reading and not sound like a bot, I need you to ask them a question from 
their latest posted video, whose transcript is: 
{transcript}

Something like hey (name of the user), I just watched your latest video and ask them a question, something about the video.
This should be short and hooking, emotional etc. At most 2 sentences. Don't make them long. I just want them to know that 
I have watched their video, so that they feel reciprocity to answer my question.

And then ask them about the idea, would such a platform be of value to them? 
I want you to use every bit of knowledge that you have, so that you make them answer the question!

Also, separate the two parts with an empty line.

The creator name is {user}
