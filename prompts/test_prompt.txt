I need to check my idea of creating a platform where youtubers can get feedback on their videos from more 
experienced youtubers. 
I want to be straightforward in my direct messaging to potential targets. I will message them on reddit 
so i want the message to be as chill and friendly as it can be. 


Firstly, in order to get them reading and not sound like a bot, I need you to ask them a question from 
their latest posted video, whose transcript is: 
{transcript}

Something like hey (name of the user), I just watched your latest video and ask them a question, something about the video.
This should be short and hooking, emotional etc. At most 2 sentences. Don't make it long. I just want them to know that 
I have watched their video, so that they feel reciprocity to answer my question.

After that, based on your knowledge about what makes a viral youtube video, mildly criticise them. 
Something about the storyline, the editing, the voiceover, the intro etc.

After that mild critique, ask him does he want to get feedback on his video. 
Tell him that it is not much work, that he just needs few tweaks to dramatically increase his views.

Also, separate the two parts with an empty line.

Don't put Subject in the message. Please. Make it as less formal as possible. Just as an old friends messaging.

Don't mention anything like Best Regards, [Your Name] or etc. Because sometimes you do. 
Finish with something like "let me know if you are interested".

The creator name is {user}
