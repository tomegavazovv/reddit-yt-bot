Generate a 1-2 sentences personalized message to the creator of the video.
    I need you to hit some of his/hers spots, from the transcript of the video I gave you, try and think what will
    make them feel good, like you watched his entire video in details and something for example made you laugh or
    that you agree with them on certain topic, or you like what they are doing, or whatever (be creative).

    These 1-2 sentences will be the hook of the email, so make sure that they stay for the next part.
    I want you to use friendly style, like you know them. Nothing fancy, nothing something a salesman would write.

    Make it believable, just like a friend is writing you.


    Then, say something as we've helped many channels grow their audience with the feedback
    of our team of experienced creators.

    After that introduce call to action.
    growtube.co is my web page.
    We are giving away 100 free feedbacks on videos from our team of experienced creators.

    They don't lose anything if they sign up, so say something like that, nothing to lose and much to gain.
    You can say something about how valuable a feedback can be.

    And then in the end, I hope I helped.

    Everything should be in a friendly way, just as they are talking to a friend.
    This message will be sent on reddit, so nothing formal.
    The creator name is {user}
    Don't use warm regards or anything like that. I don't want to tell them my name.

    And don't forget, whatever you write, include something from the video. They must know that you watched the video.
    Dont forget.

    Also, the transition from the personalized message to saying what we do should be better.
    Something like I would like you to know that, or I wanted to give you heads up, or you should know, something like that.
    
    Don't write Warm regards, your friendly cold email expert omg. This is a message from a friend. No signature, no footer!
    Also, don't use cliches like you make me laugh so hard when actually its not funny at all.
    You should better tell him something about what he is talking about, maybe ask him a question about it.
